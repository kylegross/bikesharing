## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project was to analyze Citibike data from New York City to support the proposal to add Citibikes to Des Moines. The snapshot in time that is represented is August 2019. The analysis is significant in that it provides potential investors with quantifiable evidence of how and why the addition of Citibikes in Des Moines will be a successful venture.

## Results
The following bullet points summarize the key takeaways from the Citibike analysis:
- Peak checkout times for all users are from 3:00 AM to 9:00 AM. This peak can be attributed to the vast number of persons that utilize Citibikes to commute to work. The lowest utilization is seen from 10:00 PM to 12:00 PM, proving that bike maintenance should be scheduled during those hours.

- In viewing checkout times by gender, it is evident that there are more male users than there are females. In order to increase the female Citibike user population, it is important to gear marketing strategies to be inclusive of all genders. For example, push female-centric marketing during Women's Appreciation Month to attract a greater audience.

- On the weekdays, Citibike is most popular from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM, and from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. This increase in activity can be attributed to people commuting to and from work. On the weekends, the hours from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM are very popular, accounting for the vast tourism population that utilizes bikesharing services to tour the city. The Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) displays similar results, with the male population as the predominant bikesharing users.

- User Trips by Gender by Weekday proves that most users are subscribers to the bikesharing service, with male subscribers making up most of the user population. Customer users utilize the bikesharing service mostly on the weekends, which is assumed to represent the a vast majority of the tourism population.

- Both the Top Starting Locations and Top Ending Locations prove that the bikesharing service is used densely in the Manhattan area, which is a major tourism location. This proves that most tourists enjoy traveling to various attractions by bike rather than by car, so it is important to have a greater density of bikes in the vicincity of tourism hot spots in Des Moines.

## Summary
The results gathered from the August 2019 bikesharing data proves that the implementation of Citibike in Des Moines will be successful. Bikesharing programs provide an alternative means of transportation for those who travel to and from work, and they prove lucrative to tourism within the city. As the utilized data provides an accurate snapshot in time of bikesharing use during the summer, it would be beneficial to conduct a complete analysis of use during the fall, winter, and spring months. It is expected that usage will decrease during the winter months, but this was not verified in the initial analysis and is important for strategic direction on how to supplement lost revenue. The additional analysis will also inform bike maintenance scheduling in the colder months.
